This is a project that was built for the practice purpose. 

NGINX = It has industry level nginx configurations

docker-compose.yml = The same can be said for the docker-compose file. 

This project has been created mostly to check the Reverse-Proxy nature of the Nginx Web Server.


// The structure goes something like the following 
1. Browser ---> Nginx
2. Nginx ---> Frontend
3. Frontend ---> Backend
4. Backend ---> Redis



Thank You...
